# F1 Website — Refactored Layout

This repository has been refactored so source files are organized under `src/` for easier maintenance.

Quick start

- Open `src/html/index.html` in your browser to preview the site locally.
- All styles are in `src/css/style.css` and scripts in `src/js/main.js`.

Commit suggestion

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: refactor project layout into src/{html,css,js,assets,data}"
git push
```

Files moved

- `index.html` -> `src/html/index.html`
- `F1.css` -> `src/css/style.css`
- `F1.js` -> `src/js/main.js`
- All images/videos -> `src/assets/`
- `data/` -> `src/data/`

Notes

- No functionality was changed; only file locations and relative paths were updated.
- If you want me to overwrite the original `README.md`, confirm and I'll replace it.
