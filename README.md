# F1 Website 🏎️

## Description  
This is my web project dedicated to Formula 1.  
The goal of the project is to simulate a mini F1 portal — with pages, dynamic functionalities (live chat), modern design, and interactive elements.  

## Features  
- Project is organized into logical folders for HTML, CSS, JS, and images (SS).  
- Built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.  
- Live chat system allowing the user to send messages and receive responses — messages remain visible permanently (like Viber/WhatsApp).  
- Responsive and modern design (styles, buttons, backgrounds, etc.)  
- Easy navigation between pages/sections (expandable as you develop the site further).  

## Technologies  
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript
